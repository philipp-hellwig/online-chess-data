# Online Chess Data
The repository for my bachelor's thesis "Leveraging Online Chess Data for Psychological Research" at the University of Amsterdam.

### Resources
- Database of all games on lichess.org by month: https://database.lichess.org/
- Lichess API documentation: https://lichess.org/api
- Python *berserk* documentation: https://berserk.readthedocs.io/
- Python *stockfish* documentation: https://pypi.org/project/stockfish/

### Steps to recreate Data acquisition as done in the paper
Disclaimer: you may have to change paths and filenames depending on how they are stored on your computer.  
1. Download data from https://database.lichess.org/
    - download the .pgn.zst file for one month.
    - extract it using Peazip(https://peazip.github.io/), (I stopped extraction after 5 minutes or so because the file was too big for my hard drive - leaving me with a partial .pgn file). 
2. Run *get_lichess_usernames.py* to extract unique usernames from the .pgn file
3. Run *Lichess_API_Scraping.ipynb*:
    - to access the API, you need to create a lichess account and generate an API token (after creating an account go to https://lichess.org/account/profile > API access tokens).
4. Run *san2lan.R* to convert SAN (short algebraic notation) to LAN (long algebraic notation).
   - this is necessary because the stockfish python implementation can only take LAN as input.
5. Run *Chess_game_stage_metrics.ipynb*:
    - you need to install stockfish (https://stockfishchess.org/) and update the reference path where the .exe is stored on your computer.
